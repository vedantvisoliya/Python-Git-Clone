# üêç pygit
A lightweight, educational reimplementation of Git in Python.
This project demonstrates how Git works under the hood by managing commits, branches, trees, and blobs without relying on Git itself.
---
## üöÄ Getting Started
Clone the Repository
```
    git clone https://github.com/vedantvisoliya/Python-Git-Clone.git
```

Run Commands

Use python or python3 prefix depending on your system:

```python
    python main.py <command>
```

---
## üìñ Commands
1. Initialize Repository

```python
    python main.py init
```
Creates a .pygit folder containing:

objects/ ‚Üí Stores Git objects (blobs, commits, trees).

ref/heads/ ‚Üí Stores branch references.

index ‚Üí Staging area (dictionary of file paths ‚Üí SHA-1).

HEAD ‚Üí Stores current branch.

2. Add Files 

```python
    python main.py add hello.txt # files
    python main.py add . # direcotry
    python main.py add hi.txt index.py go.txt # list of files
```

Stages files in the index (staging area).

Uses relative paths as keys and SHA-1 hashes as values.

3. Commit Changes

```python
    python main.py commit -m "message"
    python main.py commit -m "message" --author "Name <email>"
```

Creates a tree object for the whole directory.

Stores commit with:

    commit message
    timestamp
    author
    parent hashes

After committing:

index is cleared (stagging area emptied).

Commit object saved in .pygit/objects/.

4. Checkout Branch

```python
    python main.py checkout -b newbranch
    python main.py checkout branchname
```

checkout -b: Creates a new branch under .pygit/ref/heads/branchname.

checkout branchname: Switches branch, rebuilds the directory from the tree hash.

5. Branch Management

```python
    python main.py branch -b branchname   # Create & switch
    python main.py branch -d branchname   # Delete & move to master
    python main.py branch                 # List all branches
```

6. View Commit Logs

```python
    python main.py log
```

Displays up to 10 commits from current branch:

commit hash

author

7. Repository Status

```python
    python main.py status
```

Shows:

    Changes to be committed
    Unstaged files
    Deleted files
    Untracked files

## üèóÔ∏è Core Concepts

GitObject Class ‚Üí Base class for Git objects.

Blob ‚Üí Stores file content.

Tree ‚Üí Represents directory structure.

Commit ‚Üí Stores commit metadata.

All objects are stored in .pygit/objects/ and referenced via SHA-1.

--- 

## üå± Future Improvements

1. Garbage collector for unused objects.

2. Stash functionality.

3. Merge branches.

4. Cherry-pick commits.

5. Checkout a commit (detached HEAD).

6. Tag support.
